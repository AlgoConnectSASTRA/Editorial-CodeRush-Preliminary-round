1. For our understanding, take a single bag of chocolate.
    a. Case 1 : odd number of chocolates -> Friend 1 wins 
    b. Case 2 : even number of chocolates -> Friend 2 wins
2. In a scenario with n bags:
    a. If all bags contain an even number of chocolates, Friend 2 wins by taking chocolates from the same bags as Friend 1.
    b. If there's at least one bag with an odd number of chocolates, Friend 1 wins by exclusively taking chocolates from the odd bags.
