1. For our understanding, take a single bag of chocolate.
    a. Case 1 : odd number of chocolates -> Friend 1 wins 
    b. Case 2 : even number of chocolates -> Friend 2 wins
2. In a scenario with n bags:
    a. If all bags contain an even number of chocolates, Friend 2 wins by taking chocolates from the same bags as Friend 1.
    b. If there's at least one bag with an odd number of chocolates, Friend 1 wins. Proof is given below.

Proof for 2b:

Assume there are some odds and some evens.

1. First friend removes from all the odd bags, making every bag even
2. Second friend now has to remove from an even bag, creating an odd bag.
3. This loop goes on until bags have only 1 chocolate in it, first friend removes all 1s and wins.
